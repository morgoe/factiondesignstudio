faqs:
- question: What makes these reviews useful?
  answer: We start every project we ever work on with this review, so even if you wanted to hire us straight away for design work, we’d do this first anyway. It’s simply the best way to get a grasp on the current situation, provide a springboard to dive into new work on the project, and gives a solid plan for the future.

- question: What makes your UX Reviews different?
  answer: It’s easy to point out weaknesses in a product. You’re probably aware of some of them already. But knowing about weaknesses and knowing how to remedy them are two different things - that’s why we deliver a concrete plan, and then work with your team on implementation.

- question: Can’t we just do this in-house?
  answer: After being involved in a project for a long time, it can be hard to see the forest for the trees. In addition to our extensive experience, Faction Design Studio brings an unbiased viewpoint you can’t get in-house.

- question: How are your reports delivered?
  answer: We deliver all our documents in PDF format. We can present and review the documents with you for an additional fee.

- question: Where are you located?
  answer: We're located in Sydney, Australia, but work with clients from Europe and America too. We're used to working with every timezone.

You focus on what’s right with your product, but your customers focus on what’s wrong. The kinks you learn to overlook become pitfalls that drive your customers away.

_The Express UX Review will let you experience your product from your customers' eyes_. You’ll have short-term fixes you can implement immediately, and a roadmap for longer-term improvements.


#### What you get

1. Complete heuristic evaluation of your product
2. A list of actionable recommendations, rated in priority and effort
3. Your customers’ perspective on your product’s user experience


#### How we do it

Our Express UX Review consists of two phases:


**1. “Jobs-to-be-done”-based analysis**

Firstly, we’ll work together to determine the most important jobs your customers are trying to get done using your product. We’ll use these common tasks, scenarios and user journeys to review your existing website or application and document every usability or user experience issue we come across. Then we’ll group them, rate them in priority and implementation-effort, provide visual examples of each, and present them in a single document.


**2. Actionable Recommendations**

Next, we’ll deliver another document detailing at least a dozen “quick wins”: short-term fixes that can be implemented right now within the context of your current design. We’ll also go through longer-term issues that can be amended with a more considerable redesign.

Once we complete the review, we can also help you with implementing our recommendations (both short- and long-term), if you’d like. 



#### How much?

The Express UX Review starts at $3000. There are a number of optional extras you can choose from on the next page, so you can find something that fits both your needs and your wallet.


#### How long?

We’ll have everything to you within 30 days of us starting.
